## Overview

`iGraduate` is a command line application that acts as a centralised hub for NUS students
majoring in Information Security to plan their academic journey. With tools like the
storing of modules, listing of modules that can be taken, an academic progression indicator
and a CAP calculator, iGraduate will help students check his/her graduation progress, view modules
taken based on programme requirements and make informed decisions about future modules.
